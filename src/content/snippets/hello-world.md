Starting over. The previous iteration of this site was... heavy. Too many frameworks, too much movement.

This time, the goal is silence. <br/>
Just text, dividers, and a rotating icosahedron. Because we still need to roll for initiative.

This site is built with Astro and styled with Tailwind. The font you are reading is probably Google Sans Code, unless it fell back to Space Mono.
If you are seeing a serif font, something has gone terribly wrong.
